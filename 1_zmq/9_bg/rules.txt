The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer ! In order to do that, the player must :
- not bust (go over 21)
- outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust

1. may be played with one to eight decks of 52 cards

2. aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as ten points

3. the value of a hand is the sum of the points values of the individual cards

4. a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands

5. after the bets, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself; one of the dealer cards is dealt face up; the facedown card is called the "hole card" 

6. if the dealer has an ace showing, he will offer a side bet called "insurance"; this side wager pays 2 to 1 if the dealer's hole card is any 10 point card; insurance is optional and may bot exceed half the original wager

7. if the dealer has an ace or a ten showing, after offering insurance in case of an ace, then he will peek at his facedown card to see if he has a blackjack; if he does, then he will turn it over immediately

8. if the dealer does have a blackjack, then all wagers (except insurance) will lose, unless the player also has a blackjack, which will result in a push; the dealer will resolve insurance wagers at this time

9. play begins with the player to the dealer's left; here are the choices available to the player:
- stand (do nothign)
- hit (draw another card, and more if he wishes; if this card causes the player to exceed 21, then he loses)
- double (player doubles his bet and gets one (and only one) more card)
- split (if the player has a pair or any two 10-point cards, then he may double his bet and separate his cards into two individual hands; the dealer will automatically give each hand a second card; then the player may hit, stand or double normally; however when splitting aces, each ace gets only one card; if the player gets a ten and ace after splitting, then it counts as 21 points, not a blackjack; the player may keep re-splitting up to a total of four hands)
- surrender (the player forfeits half his wager, keeping the other half, and does not play out his hand; only available on the initial two cards)

10. after each player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card; if the dealer has 16 or less, then he will draw another card; dealer also hits on soft 17 (an ace and any number of cards totalling six points)

11. if the dealer busts, then any player who didn't already bust wins

12. if the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win

13. winning wagers pay even money, except a winning player blackjack which pays 3 to 2
